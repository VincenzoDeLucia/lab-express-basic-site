      Since a very young age, Vincenzo knew web development would be his path in
      life. That's why he spent most of it trying to become a biologist, a music
      producer, a game designer, a journalist and a professional internet troll.
      After having reached the pinnacle in each of these, he felt like it was
      time for him to make his mark in the world of web development: this
      website is the one of the first steps our hero took towards greatness.
